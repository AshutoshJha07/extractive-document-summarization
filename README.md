About Project
Extractive document summarization is a project that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for business analytics by automating the process of condensing large volumes of text data into concise summaries. The motive behind this project is to enhance efficiency and productivity in businesses by enabling quick comprehension of vast amounts of textual information.

The objective of this project is two fold:

1. Efficiency Improvement: Extractive document summarization aims to save time and resources by automating the summarization process. Instead of manually reading through lengthy documents, AI algorithms can analyze the content and extract key sentences or paragraphs that encapsulate the main ideas, enabling business analysts to quickly grasp the essence of the information.

2. Decision Support: By providing succinct summaries of documents, this project facilitates better decision-making in businesses. Executives, managers, and analysts can efficiently review reports, research papers, customer feedback, and other textual data to extract insights, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

In the context of business analytics, extractive document summarization can be applied in various scenarios:

- Market Research: Summarizing market reports, competitor analyses, and industry trends to identify opportunities and threats.
- Customer Feedback Analysis: Condensing customer reviews, surveys, and social media comments to understand customer sentiment and preferences.
- Financial Analysis: Summarizing financial reports, economic forecasts, and investment research for strategic financial planning.
- Legal Document Review: Extracting key information from legal documents, contracts, and regulations to support legal and compliance processes.
- Research and Development: Summarizing research papers, patents, and scientific articles to stay updated on technological advancements and innovation in the industry.

Overall, extractive document summarization powered by AI offers businesses a valuable tool for efficient information processing, decision support, and competitive advantage in today's data-driven landscape.
